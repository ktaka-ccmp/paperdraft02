\section{Introduction}

Recently, Linux containers have drawn significant amount of attention because they are lightweight, portable, and repeatable.
Linux containers are generally more lightweight than virtual machine (VM) clusters, 
because the containers share the kernel with the host operating system (OS), even though they maintain separate execution environments. 
They are generally portable because the process execution environments are archived into tar files, 
so whenever one attempts to run a container, the exact same file systems are restored from the archives 
even when totally different data centers are used. 
This means that containers can provide repeatable and portable execution environments.
%
For the same reasons, Linux containers are attractive for web services as well, 
and it is expected that web services consisting of container clusters would be 
capable of being migrated easily for variety of purposes. For example disaster recovery, 
cost performance improvements, legal compliance, and shortening the geographical distance to customers 
are the main concerns for web service providers in e-commerce, gaming, Financial technology(Fintech) and Internet of Things(IoT) field.
%

Several container cluster management systems, including kuberenates, docker swarm etc.,  have been proposed, which  
enable easy deployment of container clusters.
If these container cluster management systems could hide the differences in the base environments, users would be able to easily deploy a web service on different cloud providers or on on-premise data centers, without adjusting the container cluster configurations to the new environment. 
This allows a user to smoothly migrate a web service consisting of a container cluster even to the other side of the world. 

However, in actuality, the current container management systems fail to provide uniform environments across the different cloud providers. 
One of the most prominent differences they fail to hide is the way they route the incoming traffic into the container cluster.

For example in the case of the Kubernetes, a load balancer is not included in a cluster management system, and is heavily dependent on external load balancers that are set up on the fly 
by cloud providers through their application protocol interfaces (APIs). 
These external load balancers distribute incoming traffic to every server that hosts containers.
The traffic is then distributed again to destination containers using iptables destination 
network address translation (DNAT)\cite{MartinA.Brown2017,Marmol2015} rules in a round-robin manner. 
The problem happens in the environment with a load balancer that is not supported by the Kubernetes, 
e.g. in an on-premise data center with a bare metal load balancer. 
In such environments, the user needs to manually configure 
the static route for inbound traffic in an ad-hoc manner. 

In order to provide a uniform environment across the different cloud providers, it is important to have a single way of handling incoming traffic.
The author believes a rigorous study on what is the best way to do so is critical.

If we have the uniform environment across the different cloud providers including on-premise data centers, users can smoothly migrate their web services without adjusting them to the base environment.
This means that there are no cloud vendor lock-ins and users will gain the freedom as to where to run their web services.
Users will be able to use their infrasructure across the world as if it were a single computer.

The goals of this study are the followings:
1) To clarify what type of the load bbalancer architecture is suitable for web service migration.
2) To provide a software load balancer for such architecture.
3) To provide working prototype system for web service migration.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
Section \ref{Related Work} highlights work that deals specifically with container cluster migration, 
software load balancer containerization, and load balancer related tools within the context of the container technology. 
Section \ref{Routing} will explain existing architecture problems and propose our solutions.
In Section \ref{IPVS}, experimental conditions and the parameters 
that we considered to be important in our experiment will be described in detail.
Then, we will show our experimental results and discuss the obtained performance characteristics in Section~\ref{XDP loadbalancer},  
which is followed by a summary of our work in Section~\ref{Conclusions}.

The typical traditional on-premise data center used a set of load balancers to distribute the incoming traffic to cluster of servers thus providig scalability and redundancy of the service.
The traffic is routed from the out side of the infrastructure to one of the load balancers using active-backup redundancy protocol OSPF, VRRP or HSRP.
The traffic is then distributed to multiple of web servers.




Even if the load balancer becomes scalable, the actual traffic a data center infrustructure can accomodate is limited by the incoming network bandwith.

\section{Containerised IPVS software load balancer}\label{IPVS}


The author and his collegue proposed a portable load balancer for the Kubernetes cluster systems 
that is aimed at facilitating migration of container clusters for web services.
We implemented a containerized software load balancer that is run by Kubernetes as a part of container cluster, 
using Linux kernel's IPVS, as a proof of concept.
In order to discuss the feasibility of the proposed load balancer, we built 
a Kubernetes cluster system and conducted performance measurements.
Our experimental results indicate that the IPVS based load balancer in container improves the portability of 
the Kubernetes cluster system while it shows the similar performance levels as the existing iptables DNAT based load balancer.
We also clarified that choosing the right operating modes of overlay networks is important for the performance of load balancers. 
For example, in the case of flannel, only the vxlan and udp backend operation modes could be used 
in the cloud environment, and the udp backend significantly degraded their performance.
Furthermore, we also learned that the distribution of packet processing among multiple CPUs was very important
to obtain the maximum performance levels from load balancers.
%

The limitations of this work that authors aware of include the followings: 
1) We have not discussed the load balancer redundancy. 
Routing traffic to one of the load balancers while keeping redundancy in the container environment is a complex issue,
because standard Layer 2 rendandacy protocols, e.g. VRRP or OSPF\cite{moy1997ospf} that uses multicast, can not be used in many cases.
Further more, providing uniform methods independent of various cloud environments and on-premise datacenter is much more difficult.   
2) Experiments are conducted only in a 1Gbps network environment.
The experimental results indicate the performance of IPVS may be limited by the network bandwidth, 1Gbps, in our experiments. 
Thus, experiments with the faster network setting, e.g. 10Gigabit ethernet, are needed to investigate the feasibility of the proposed load balancer.
3) We have not yet compared the performance level of proposed load balance with those of cloud provider's load balancers.
It shoud be fair to compare the performance of proposed load balancer with those of the combination of the cloud load balancer and the iptables DNAT. 
The authors leave these issues for future work and they will be discussed elsewhere.


Even though we could successfully containerised the load balancers and could deploy it as a part of web service, the performance we was not equivalent that of scalable load balancers provided by the GCP.

The next section will disscuss how to improve the performance levels of the open source software load balancer. 

\section{XDP loadbalancer}\label{XDP loadbalancer}
The ipvs is very dependent on netfilter and linux kernel network stack.
The IP packet processing of the linux kernel have been claimed to be inefficient, and thus unable to meet the speed requirement of 10Gbps and above.
Several alternative ways to increase the speed of the packet processig have been proposed.
Most bypass the linux kernel network stack and proccess the packet in user spaces.
While they may improve the performace level in certain applications, they all have some issues regarding compatibility because of the bypass.
Often times they require designated physical NIC, other than the one used for normal linux services, e.g. ssh.

This table summarize, proposed techniques to improve the sepped of the packet processing.

Recently, the linux kernel introduced eXpress Data Plane(XDP)[ref] the novel way to improve the IP processing speed, while keeping compatibility with the other functions of the linux netwoking stack.

By using the XDP infrastructure, a user can write a code that proccess packets in very early stage of accepting the traffic from out side the linux box.
It will enable a user to inject the packet proccessing byte code into the kernel, let the kernel compile it into native machine code and then the code will manupulate the packet only if it matches the predefined conditions.
Packets that are not matched the conditions are pass to the normal Linux kernel's networking stack.

The advantage of XDP can be summarized as follows:
(1)The packet manipulation is very fast, since it can tap the very early stage of packe processing flow.
(2)Since it only affects the packet that matches the predefined conditions, irrelevant packet flows are proccessed by the kernel networks stack as usual.
(3)The XDP code can be writen in C code, compiled into byte codes using clang compiler and loaded into kernel whenever a user have needs.
However the kernel modules are not meant to be written and loaded casually to meet the users varying needs.
The latter could crash the kernel, while the former has built in protection against it.

In the course of the study the auther come to belive that it is critical to provide a software load balancer that is faster than the existing ipvs.

The author started to write a prototype code of XDP load balancer.
Here the design and the prototype implementation are presented.

\section{Conclusion}\label{Conclusion}
The general architechture of container cluster and the load balancer configurations are discussed.
The lateral scalability of the load balancer itself is critical in order to meet the future demand of the large scale services. The traffic distribution using the flow based ECMP routing from upstream router will eliminate bottlneck inside the cluster infrastructure.

The author and collegue also investigatd containerization of ipvs load balancer using Kubernetes.
They revealed that this will improve the portability of the service while keeping the performance level of conventional architecture.
